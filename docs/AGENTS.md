## 🔧 Agent Configuration

Agents are configured through the `AgentMetadata` class:

```python
@dataclass
class AgentMetadata:
    name: str
    agent_type: AgentType
    description: str
    capabilities: List[str]
    model_requirements: List[str]
    priority: int = 1
    max_concurrent_tasks: int = 1
    timeout_seconds: int = 300
    retry_count: int = 3
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Single Agent Task
```python
# Execute a single agent task
architect = agent_registry.get_agent("architect")
result = await architect.execute({
    "content": "Design a REST API for user management",
    "session_id": "user_session_123"
})
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow
```python
# Execute complete workflow
workflow_result = await integration_manager.execute_workflow({
    "content": "Create a web application with user authentication",
    "session_id": "user_session_123"
})
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- **Parallel Execution**: Agents can run concurrently where possible
- **Smart Routing**: Tasks are routed to the most appropriate agent
- **Memory Sharing**: Agents share context through unified memory system
- **Caching**: Frequently used results are cached for faster access
- **Load Balancing**: Tasks are distributed across available model instances

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All agent inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Agents have built-in rate limiting and timeout protection
- **Secure Memory**: Memory access is controlled with proper authorization
- **Audit Logging**: All agent activities are logged for security monitoring
- **Model Safety**: AI models are configured with appropriate safety filters

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Adding New Agents
1. Implement the `BaseAgent` interface
2. Define agent metadata and capabilities
3. Register with the agent registry
4. Add integration to the workflow pipeline
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

### Agent Best Practices
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Each agent should have well-defined capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Efficient memory usage and cleanup
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Testing**: Thorough unit and integration testing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Agent Not Found**: Check agent registration in the registry
- **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout or optimize task complexity
- **Memory Issues**: Check memory usage and cleanup procedures
- **Model Errors**: Verify API keys and model availability

### Debug Tools
- **Agent Status**: Check agent status and health
- **Memory Explorer**: Inspect memory contents and relationships
