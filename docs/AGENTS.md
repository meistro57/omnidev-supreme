## 🔧 Agent Configuration

Agents are configured through the `AgentMetadata` class:

```python
@dataclass
class AgentMetadata:
    name: str
    agent_type: AgentType
    description: str
    capabilities: List[str]
    model_requirements: List[str]
    priority: int = 1
    max_concurrent_tasks: int = 1
    timeout_seconds: int = 300
    retry_count: int = 3
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Single Agent Task
```python
# Execute a single agent task
architect = agent_registry.get_agent("architect")
result = await architect.execute({
    "content": "Design a REST API for user management",
    "session_id": "user_session_123"
})
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow
```python
# Execute complete workflow
workflow_result = await integration_manager.execute_workflow({
    "content": "Create a web application with user authentication",
    "session_id": "user_session_123"
})
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- **Parallel Execution**: Agents can run concurrently where possible
- **Smart Routing**: Tasks are routed to the most appropriate agent
- **Memory Sharing**: Agents share context through unified memory system
- **Caching**: Frequently used results are cached for faster access
- **Load Balancing**: Tasks are distributed across available model instances

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Secure Memory**: Memory access is controlled with proper authorization
- **Audit Logging**: All agent activities are logged for security monitoring
- **Model Safety**: AI models are configured with appropriate safety filters

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Adding New Agents
